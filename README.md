The program I created takes a name as input and assigns it to the variable name.  It then prompts the user for their age and asssigns it to the variable human_age.  It uses a while loop and try and except to make sure that the user inputs either an integer or floating point number.  If they do not input a number, it prompts them to enter a number.
