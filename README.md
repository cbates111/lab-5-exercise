# About The Project

The Animal Age Project is an open-source project for a program that allows you to see what your age would be as an animal of your choice.  With hundreds of animals to choose from, a user only needs to input their age and a few phsyical traits such as height and weight. The program then uses these inputs to determine the user's age as their selected animal.
